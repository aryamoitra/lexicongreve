Yes, and whosoever has it about him, bears an Enemy in his Breast: For your honest man, as I take it, is that nice, scrupulous, conscientious Person, who will cheat no body but himself; such another Coxcomb, as your wise man, who is too hard for all the World, and will be made a Fool of by no body, but himself: Ha, ha, ha. Well for Wisdom and Honesty, give me Cunning and Hypocrisie; oh 'tis such a pleasure, to angle for fair-faced Fools! then that hungry Gudgeon Credulity, will bite at any thing— Why, let me see, I have the same Face, the same Words and Accents, when I speak what I do think; and when I speak what I do not think— the very same— and dear dissimulation is the only Art, not to be known from Nature. Why will Mankind be Fools, and be deceiv'd? And why are Friends and Lovers Oaths believ'd; When each, who searches strictly his own mind, May so much Fraud and Power of Baseness find?\"],\n",
