            <edition>This text is an enriched version of the TCP digital transcription A34302 of text R8699 in the <ref target="A34302-http;//estc.bl.uk">English Short Title Catalog</ref> (Wing C5851). Textual changes  and metadata enrichments aim at making the                             text more  computationally tractable, easier to read, and suitable for network-based collaborative                              curation by amateur and professional end users from many walks of life.  The text has been tokenized and linguistically annotated with <ref target="http://morphadorner.northwestern.edu/morphadorner/">MorphAdorner</ref>. The annotation includes standard spellings that support the display of a text in                             a standardized format that preserves archaic forms ('loveth', 'seekest').                              Textual changes aim at restoring the text the author or stationer meant to publish.</edition>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES Earl of Dorset and <hi>Middlesex, Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's Houshold, and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, </hi>&amp;c. </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD, </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A Young Poet, is liable to the same Vanity and Indiscretion with a Young Lover; and the Great Man that smiles upon one, and the Fine Woman that looks kindly upon t' other, are each of 'em in Danger of having the Favour publish'd with the first Opportunity. </p>
            <p>But there may be a different Motive, which will a little distinguish the Offenders. For tho' one should have a Vanity in ruining another's Reputation, yet the other may only have an Ambition to advance his own. <pb n="4a" xml:id="A34302-004-a"/>And I beg leave, my Lord, that I may plead the latter, both as the Cause and Excuse of this Dedication. </p>
            <p>Whoever is King, is also the Father of his Country; and as no body can dispute Your Lordship's Monarchy in Poetry; so all that are concern'd, ought to acknowledge Your Universal Patronage: And it is only presuming on the Priviledge of a Loyal Subject, that I have ventur'd to make this my Address of Thanks, to Your Lordship; which at the same time, includes a Prayer for Your Protection. </p>
            <p>I am not Ignorant of the Common Form of Poetical Dedications, which are generally made up of Panegyricks, where the Authors endeavour to distinguish their Patrons, by the shining Characters they give them, above other Men. But that, my Lord, is not my business at this time, nor is Your Lordship now to be distinguish'd. I am contented with the Honour I do my self in this Epistle; without the Vanity of attempting to add to, or explain Your Lordship's Character. </p>
            <p>I confess it is not without some strugling, that I behave my self in this Case, as I ought: For it is very hard to be pleased with a Subject, and yet forbear it. But I chuse rather to follow Pliny's Precept, than his Example, when in his Panegyrick to the Emperour Trajan, he says, <q cert="high" xml:lang="lat">
                  <l cert="high" xml:lang="lat">Nec minus considerabo quid aures ejus pati </l>
                  <l cert="high" xml:lang="lat">possint, Quam quid virtutibus debeatur. </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I hope I may be excus'd the Pedantry of a Quotation, when it is so justly apply'd. Here are some Lines <pb n="4b" xml:id="A34302-004-b"/>in the Print, (and which your Lordship read before this Play was Acted) that were omitted on the Stage; and particularly one whole Scene in the Third Act, which not only helps the Design forward with less Precipitation, but also heightens the ridiculous Character of Foresight, which indeed seems to be maim'd without it. But I found my self in great danger of a long Play, and was glad to help it where I could. Tho' notwithstanding my Care, and the kind Reception it had from the Town; I could heartily wish it yet shorter: But the Number of Different Characters represented in it, would have been too much crowded in less room. </p>
            <p>This Reflection on Prolixity, (a Fault, for which scarce any one Beauty will attone) warns me not to be tedious now, and detain Your Lordship any longer with the Trifles of, </p>
            <closer>
               <salute>MY LORD, </salute>

            <l>CUSTOM, which every where bears mighty Sway, </l>
            <l>Brings me to act the Orator to Day: </l>
            <l>But Women, you will say, are ill at Speeches, </l>
            <l>'Tis true, and therefore I appear in Breeches: </l>
            <l>Not for Example to you City-Wives; </l>
            <l>That by Prescription's setled for your Lives. </l>
            <l>Was it for gain the Husband first consented? </l>

            <l>Whose Favours have prevented our undoing; </l>
            <l>A long Egyptian Bondage we endur'd, </l>
            <l>Till Freedom, by your Iustice we procur'd: </l>
            <l>Our Taskmasters were grown such very Jews, </l>
            <l>We must at length have Play'd in Wooden Shooes, </l>
            <l>Had not your Bounty taught us to refuse. </l>
            <l>Freedom's of English growth, I think, alone; </l>
            <l>What for lost English Freedom can attone? </l>
            <l>A Free-born Player loaths to be compell'd; </l>
            <l>Our Rulers Tyraniz'd, and We Rebell'd. </l>
            <l>Freedom! the Wise Man's Wish, the Poor Man's Wealth; </l>
            <l>Which you, and I, and most of us enjoy by Stealth; </l>
            <l>The Soul of Pleasure, and the Sweet of Life, </l>
            <l>The Woman's Charter, Widdow, Maid or Wife, </l>
            <l>This they'd have cancell'd, and thence grew the Strife. </l>
            <l>But you perhaps, wou'd have me here confess </l>
            <l>How we obtain'd the Favour; — Can't you guess? </l>
            <l>Why then I'll tell you, (for I hate a Lye) </l>
            <l>By Brib'ry, errant Brib'ry, let me dye: </l>
            <l>I was their Agent, but by Iove I swear </l>
            <l>No honourable Member had a share </l>
            <l>Tho' young and able Members bid me Fair: </l>
            <l>I chose a wiser way to make you willing, </l>
            <l>Which has not cost the House a single Shilling; </l>
            <l>Now you suspect at least I went a Billing. </l>
            <l>You see I'm Young, and to that Air of Youth, </l>
            <l>Some will add Beauty, and a little Truth; </l>
            <l>These Pow'rful Charms, improv'd by Pow'rful Arts, </l>
            <l>Prevail'd to captivate your op'ning Hearts. </l>
            <pb n="6b" xml:id="A34302-006-b"/>
            <l>Thus furnish'd, I prefer'd my poor Petition, </l>
            <l>And brib'd ye to commiserate our Condition: </l>
            <l>I Laugh'd, and Sigh'd, and Sung, and Leer'd upon ye; </l>
            <l>With Roguish Loving Looks, and that way won ye: </l>
            <l>The Young Men kiss'd me, and the Old I kiss'd, </l>
            <l>And luringly, I led them as I list. </l>
            <l>The Ladies in meer Pity took our Parts, </l>
            <l>Pity's the darling Passion of their Hearts. </l>
            <l>Thus Bribing, or thus Brib'd, fear no Disgraces; </l>

            <head type="sub">Spoken at the opening of the New House, By Mr. Betterton. </head>
            <l>THE Husbandman in vain renews his Toil, </l>
            <l>To cultivate each Year a hungry Soil; </l>
            <l>And fondly hopes for rich and generous Fruit, </l>
            <l>When what should feed the Tree, devours the Root: </l>
            <l>Th▪ unladen Boughs, he sees, bode certain Dearth, </l>
            <l>Unless transplanted to more kindly Earth. </l>
            <l>So, the poor Husbands of the Stage, who found </l>
            <l>Their Labours lost upon the ungrateful Ground, </l>
            <l>This last and only Remedy have prov'd; </l>
            <l>And hope new Fruit from ancient Stocks remov'd. </l>
            <l>Well may they hope, when you so kindly aid, </l>
            <l>And plant a Soil which you so rich have made. </l>
            <l>As Nature gave the World to Man's first Age, </l>
            <l>So▪ from your Bounty, we receive this Stage; </l>
            <l>The Freedom Man was born to, you've restor'd, </l>
            <l>And to our World, such Plenty you afford, </l>
            <l>It seems like Eden, fruitful of its own accord. </l>
            <l>But since in Paradise frail Flesh gave way, </l>
            <l>And when but two were made, both went astray; </l>
            <l>Forbear your Wonder, and the Fault forgive, </l>
            <l>If in our larger Family we grieve </l>
            <l>One falling Adam, and one tempted Eve. </l>
            <l>We who remain, would gratefully repay </l>
            <l>What our Endeavours can, and bring this day, </l>
            <l>The First-fruit. Offering, of a Virgin Play. </l>
            <pb n="7b" xml:id="A34302-007-b"/>
            <l>We hope there's something that may please each Taste, </l>
            <l>And tho' of Homely Fare we make the Feast, </l>
            <l>Yet you will find variety at least. </l>
            <l>There's Humour, which for chearful Friends we got, </l>
            <l>And for the thinking Party there's a Plot. </l>
            <l>We've something too, to gratifie ill Nature, </l>
            <l>(If there be any here) and that is Satire. </l>
            <l>Tho Satire scarce dares grin, 'tis grown so mild; </l>
            <l>Or only shews its Teeth, as if it smil'd. </l>
            <l>As Asses Thistles, Poets mumble Wit, </l>
            <l>And dare not bite, for fear of being bit. </l>
            <l>They hold their Pens, as Swords are held by Fools, </l>
            <l>And are afraid to use their own▪ Edge-Tools. </l>
            <l>Since the Plain-Dealers Scenes of Manly Rage, </l>
            <l>Not one has dar'd to lash this Crying Age. </l>
            <l>This time, the Poet owns the bold Essay, </l>
            <l>Yet hopes there's no ill-manners in his Play: </l>
            <l>And he declares by me, he has design'd </l>
            <l>Affront to none, but frankly speaks his mind. </l>
            <l>And shou'd the ensuing Scenes not chance to hit, </l>
            <l>He offers but this one Excuse, 'twas writ </l>
            <l>Before your late Encouragement of Wit. </l>

            <head>EPILOGUE </head>
            <head type="sub">Spoken at the opening of the New House, By Mrs. Bracegirdle. </head>
            <l>SURE Providence at first, design'd this Place </l>
            <l>To be the Player's Refuge in distress; </l>
            <l>For still in every Storm, they all run hither, </l>
            <l>As to a Shed, that shields 'em from the Weather. </l>
            <l>But thinking of this change which last befel us, </l>
            <l>It's like what I have heard our Poets tell us: </l>
            <l>For when behind our Scenes their Suits are pleading, </l>
            <l>To help their Love, sometimes they show their Reading; </l>
            <l>And wanting ready Cash to pay for Hearts, </l>
            <l>They top their Learning on us, and their Parts. </l>
            <l>Once of Philosophers they told us Stories, </l>
            <l>Whom, as I think they call'd— Py— Pythagories, </l>
            <l>I'm sure 'tis some such Latin Name they give 'em, </l>
            <l>And we, who know no better, must believe 'em. </l>
            <l>Now to these Men (say they) such Souls were given, </l>
            <l>That after Death, ne're went to Hell, nor Heaven, </l>
            <l>But liv'd, I know not how, in Beasts; and then </l>
            <l>When many Years were past, in Men again. </l>
            <l>Methinks, we Players resemble such a Soul, </l>
            <l>That, does from Bodies, we from Houses strole. </l>
            <l>Thus Aristotle's Soul, of old that was, </l>
            <l>May now be damn'd to animate an Ass; </l>
            <pb n="8b" xml:id="A34302-008-b"/>
            <l>Or in this very House, for ought we know, </l>
            <l>Is doing painful Penance in some Beau, </l>
            <l>And this our Audience, which did once resort </l>
            <l>To shining Theatres to see our Sport, </l>
            <l>Now find us toss'd into a Tennis-Court. </l>
            <l>These Walls but t▪ other Day were fill'd with Noise </l>
            <l>Of Roaring Gamesters, and your <hi>Damme Boys</hi>. </l>
            <l>Then bounding Balls and Rackets they encompass'd, </l>
            <l>And now they're fill'd with Iests, and Flights, and Bombast! </l>
            <l>I vow, I don't much like this Transmigration, </l>
            <l>Stroling from Place to Place, by Circulation. </l>
            <l>Grant Heaven, we don't return to our first Station. </l>
            <l>I know not what these think, but for my Part, </l>
            <l>I can't reflect without an aking Heart, </l>
            <l>How we shou'd end in our Original, a Cart. </l>
            <l>But we can't fear, since you're so good to save us, </l>
            <l>That you have only set us up, to leave us. </l>
            <l>Thus from the past, we hope for future Grace, </l>
            <l>I beg it— </l>
            <l>And some here know I have a begging Face. </l>
            <l>Then pray continue this your kind behaviour, </l>
            <l>For a clear Stage won't do, without your Favour. </l>

                     <p>Sir, you're a Gentleman, and probably understand this fine Feeding: But if you please, I had rather be at Board-Wages. Does your Epictetus, or your Seneca here, or any of these poor, rich Rogues, teach you how to pay your Debts without Money? Will they shut up the Mouths of your Creditors? Will Plato be Bail for you? Or Diogenes, because he understands Confinement, <pb n="10a" xml:id="A34302-010-a"/>and liv'd in a Tub, go to Prison for you? 'Slife, Sir, what do you mean, to mew your self up here with Three or Four musty Books, in commendation of Starving and Poverty? </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val. </speaker>
                     <p>Why, Sirrah, I have no Money, you know it; and therefore resolve to rail at all that have: And in that I but follow the Examples of the wisest and wittiest Men in all Ages; these Poets and Philosophers whom you naturally hate, for just such another Reason; because they abound in Sense, and you are a Fool. </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iere. </speaker>
                     <p>Aye, Sir, I am a Fool, I know it: And yet, Heav'n help me, I'm poor enough to be a Wit— But I was always a Fool, when I told you what your Expences would bring you to; your Coaches and your Liveries; your Treats and your Balls; your being in Love with a Lady, that did not care a Farthing for you in your Prosperity; and keeping Company with Wits, that car'd for nothing but your Prosperity; and now when you are poor, hate you as much as they do one another. </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val. </speaker>
                     <p>Well; and now I am poor, I have an opportunity to be reveng'd on 'em all; I'll pursue Angelica with more Love than ever, and appear more notoriously her Admirer in this Restraint, than when I openly rival'd the rich Fops, that made Court to her; so shall my Poverty be a Mortification to her Pride, and perhaps, make her compassionate that Love, which has principally reduc'd me to this Lowness of Fortune. And for the Wits, I'm sure I'm in a Condition to be even with them— </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iere. </speaker>
                     <p>Nay, your Condition is pretty even with theirs, that's the truth on't. </p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Val. </speaker>

                     <speaker>Iere. </speaker>

                     <p>Hem! — Sir, if you please to give me a small Certificate of Three Lines— only to certifie those whom it may concern; That the Bearer hereof, <hi>Ieremy Fetch </hi>by Name, has for the space of Sev'n Years truly and faithfully serv'd <hi>Valentine Legend </hi>Esq and that he is not now turn'd away for any Misdemeanour; but does voluntarily dismiss his Master from any future Authority over him— </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Val. </speaker>
                     <p>No, Sirrah, you shall live with me still. </p>

                     <p>Sir, it's impossible— I may die with you, starve with you, or be dam'd with your Works: But to live even Three days, the Life of a Play, I no more expect it, than to be Canoniz'd for a Muse after my Decease. </p>

                     <p>You are witty, you Rogue, I shall want your Help; — I'll have you learn to make Couplets, to tag the ends of Acts: d'ye hear, get the Maids to Crambo in an Evening, and learn the knack of Rhiming; you may arrive at the height of a Song, sent by an unknown Hand, or a Chocolate-House Lampoon. </p>

                     <p>But Sir, Is this the way to recover your Father's Favour? Why Sir Sampson will be irreconcilable. If your Younger Brother shou'd come from Sea, he'd never look upon you again. You're undone, Sir; you're ruin'd; you won't have a Friend left in the World, if you turn Poet— Ah Pox confound that Will's Coffee-House, it has ruin'd more Young Men than the Royal-Oak Lottery— Nothing thrives that belongs to't. The Man of the House would have been an Alderman by this time with half the Trade, if he had set up in the City— For my part, I never sit at the Door, that I don't get double the Stomach that I do at a Horse-Race. The Air upon Banstead-Downs is nothing to it for a Whetter; yet I never see it, but the Spirit of Famine appears to me; sometimes like a decay'd Porter, worn out with pimping, and carrying Billet-doux and Songs; not like other Porters for Hire, but for the Jests sake. Now like a thin Chairman, melted down to half his Proportion, with carrying a Poet upon Tick, to visit some great Fortune; and his Fare to be paid him like the Wages of Sin, either at the Day of Marriage, or the Day of Death. </p>

                     <p>Sometimes like a bilk'd Bookseller, with a meagre terrify'd Countenance, that looks as if he had written for himself, or were resolv'd to turn Author, and bring the rest of his Brethren into the same Condition. And Lastly, In the Form of a worn-out Punk, with Verses in her Hand, which her Vanity had prefer'd to Settlements, without a whole Tatter to her Tail, but as ragged as one of the Muses; or as if she were carrying her Linnen to the Paper-Mill, to be converted into Folio Books, of Warning to all Young Maids, not to prefer Poetry to good Sense; or lying in the Arms of a needy Wit, before the Embraces of a wealthy Fool. </p>

                     <speaker>Scan. </speaker>
                     <p>Poet! He shall turn Soldier first, and rather depend upon the outside of his Head, than the Lining. Why, what the Devil has not your Poverty made you Enemies enough? Must you needs shew your Wit to get more? </p>

You may stand at Bay for a while; but when the full Cry is against you, you won't have fair Play for your Life. If you can't be fairly run down by the Hounds, you will be treacherously shot by the Huntsmen. — No, turn Pimp, Flatterer, Quack, Lawyer, Parson, be Chaplain to an Atheist, or Stallion to an Old Woman, any thing but Poet; a Modern Poet is worse, more servile, timorous, and fawning, than any I have nam'd: Without you could retrieve the Ancient Honours of the Name, recall the Stage of Athens, and be allow'd the force of open honest Satire. </p>

                     <speaker>Val. </speaker>
                     <p>No; He has sent me the hardest Conditions in the World: You have heard of a Booby-Brother of mine, that was sent to Sea three Years ago? This Brother, my Father hears is Landed; whereupon he very affectionately sends me word; If I will make a Deed of Conveyance of my Right to his Estate after his Death, to my younger Brother, he will immediately furnish me with Four thousand Pound to pay my Debts, and make my Fortune. This was once propos'd before, and I refus'd it; but the present impatience of my Creditors for their Money, and my own impatience of Confinement, and absence from Angelica, force me to consent. </p>

                     <speaker>Val. </speaker>
                     <p>You know her temper; she never gave me any great reason either for hope or despair. </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Scan. </speaker>
                     <p>Women of her airy temper, as they seldom think before they act, so they rarely give us any light to guess at what they mean: But you have little reason to believe that a Woman of this Age, who has had an indifference for you in your Prosperity, will fall in love with your ill Fortune; besides, Angelica has a great Fortune of her own; and great Fortunes either expect another great Fortune, or a Fool. </p>

                     <p>A mender of Reputations! aye, just as he is a keeper of secrets, another Vertue that he sets up for in the same manner. For the Rogue will speak aloud in the posture of a Whisper; and deny a Womans name, while he gives you the marks of her Person: He will forswear receiving a Letter from her, and at the same time, <pb n="14a" xml:id="A34302-014-a"/>shew you her Hand upon the Superscription: And yet perhaps he has Counterfeited the Hand too; and sworn to a truth; but he hopes not to be believ'd; and refuses the reputation of a Ladies favour, as a Doctor says, No, to a Bishoprick, only that it may be granted him. — In short, he is a publick Professor of Secresie, and makes Proclamation that he holds private Intelligence. — He's here. </p>

                     <p>Why Tattle, you need not be much concern'd at any thing that he says: For to converse with Scandal, is to play at <hi>Losing Loadum</hi>; you must lose a good Name to him, before you can win it for your self. </p>

                     <speaker>Tatt. </speaker>
                     <p>But how Barbarous that is, and how unfortunate for him, that the World shall think the berter of any Person for his Calumniation! — I thank Heav'n, it has always been a part of my Character, to handle the Reputation of others very tenderly. </p>

                     <p>Nay, but why rotten? Why should you say rotten, when you know not the persons of whom you speak? How cruel that is? </p>

                     <p>Ha, ha, ha; nay, now you make a Jest of it indeed. For there is nothing more known, than that no body knows any thing of that nature of me: As I hope to be sav'd, Valentine, I never expos'd a Woman, since I knew what Woman was. </p>

                     <speaker>Val. </speaker>
                     <p>What you will allow an absent Lover— </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frail. </speaker>
                     <p>No, I'll allow a Lover present with his Mistress to be particular— But otherwise I think his Passion ought to give place to his Manners. </p>

                     <p>Marriage indeed may qualifie the Fury of his Passion, but it very rarely mends a Man's Manners. </p>

                     <speaker>Frail. </speaker>
                     <p>You are the most mistaken in the World; there is no Creature perfectly Civil, but a Husband. For in a little time he grows only rude to his Wife, and that is the highest good Breeding, for it begets his Civility to other People. Well, I'll tell you News; but I suppose you hear your Brother Benjamin is landed. And my Brother Foresight's Daughter is come out of the Country— I assure you, there's a Match talk'd of by the Old People— Well, if he be but as great a Sea-Beast, as she is a Land-Monster, we shall have a most Amphibious Breed— The Progeny will be all Otters: he has been bred at Sea, and she has never been out of the Country. </p>

He would have perswaded me, that this was an Unlucky Day, and wou'd not let me come abroad: But I invented a Dream, and sent him to Artimodorus for Interpretation, and so stole out to see you. Well, and what will you give me now? Come, I must have something. </p>

Very well pleas'd at my Stocking— Oh here's my Neice! — </p>

                     <p>What, wou'd you be gadding too? Sure all Females are mad to day— It is of evil portent, and bodes Mischief▪ to the Master of a Family— I remember an old Prophesie written by Messehalah the Arabian, and thus translated by a Reverend Buckinghamshire Bard. <q>
                           <l>When Housewifes all the House forsake, </l>
                           <l>And leave good Man to Brew and Bake, </l>

                     <p>Fruitful, the Head fruitful, that bodes Horns; the Fruit of the Head is Horns— Dear Neice, stay at home— For by the Head of the House is meant the Husband; the Prophecy needs no Explanation. </p>

                     <p>But my Inclinations are in force, I have a mind to go abroad; and if you won't lend me your Coach, I'll take a Hackney, or a Chair, and leave you to erect a Scheme, and find who's in Conjunction with your Wife. Why don't you keep her at Home, if you're Jealous when she's abroad? You know my Aunt is a little Retrograde (as you call it) in her Nature. Uncle, I'm afraid you are not Lord of the Ascendant, ha, ha, ha. </p>

                     <p>Nay Uncle, don't be angry— If you are, I'll reap up all your false Prophecies, ridiculous Dreams, and idle Divinations. I'll swear you are a Nusance to the Neighbourhood— What a Bustle did you keep against the last Invisible Eclipse, laying in Provision as 'twere for a Siege? What a World of Fire and Candle, Matches and Tinderboxes did you purchase! One would have thought we were ever after to live under Ground, or at least making a Voyage to Greenland, to inhabit there all the dark Season. </p>

                     <p>Well, as an earnest of Friendship and Confidence: I'll acquaint You with a design that I have: To tell Truth, and speak openly one to another; I'm afraid the World have observ'd us more than we have observ'd one another. You have a Rich Husband, and are provided for, I am at a loss, and have no great Stock either of Fortune or Reputation; and therefore must look sharply about me. Sir Sampson has a Son that is expected to Night; and by the Account I have heard of his Education, can be no Conjurer: The Estate You know is to be made over to him: — Now if I cou'd wheedle him, Sister, ha? You understand me? </p>

                     <p>I do; and will help you to the utmost of my power— And I can tell you one thing that falls out luckily enough; my awkard Daughter-in-Law, who you know is design'd for his Wife, is grown fond of Mr. Tattle; now if we can improve that, and make her have an Aversion for the Booby, it may go a great way towards his liking of you. Here they come together; and let us contrive some way or other to leave 'em together. </p>

                     <speaker>Tatt. </speaker>
                     <p>Why you must say no, or you believe not, or you can't tell— </p>

                     <speaker>Tatt. </speaker>
                     <p>Yes, if you would be well bred. All well-bred Persons Lie— Besides, you are a Woman, You must never speak what you think: Your words must contradict your thoughts; but your actions may contradict your words. So, when I ask you, if you can Love me, you must say no, but you must Love me too— If I tell you you are Handsome, you must deny it, and say I flatter you— But you must think your self more <pb n="25b" xml:id="A34302-025-b"/>Charming than I speak you: — And like me, for the Beauty which I say you have, as much as if I had it my self— If I ask you to Kiss me, you must be angry, but you must not refuse me. If I ask you for more, you must be more angry, — but more complying; and as soon as ever I make you say you'l cry out, you must be sure to hold your Tongue. </p>

                     <p>I dare swear you wrong him, it is his own— And Mr. Tattle only judges of the Success of others, from the Effects of his own Merit. For certainly Mr. Tattle was never deny'd any thing in his Life. </p>

                     <p>Faith, Madam, you're in the right; no more I have, as I hope to be sav'd; I never had it in my Power to say any thing to a Lady's Prejudice in my Life— For as I was telling you Madam, I have been the most unsuccessful Creature living, in things of that nature; and never had the good Fortune to be trusted once with a Lady's Secret, not once. </p>

                     <p>O pox, Scandal, that was too far put— Never have told Particulars, Madam. Perhaps I might have talk'd as of a Third Person— or have introduc'd an Amour of my own, in Conversation, by way of Novel: but never have explain'd Particulars. </p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Ang. </speaker>
                     <p>But whence comes the Reputation of Mr. Tattle's Secresie, if he was never trusted? </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Scan. </speaker>
                     <p>Why thence it arises— The thing is proverbially spoken; but may be apply'd to him— As if we shou'd say in general Terms, He only is Secret who never was trusted; a Satyrical Proverb upon our Sex— There's another upon yours— As she is chaste, who was never ask'd the Question. That's all. </p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>A couple of very civil Proverbs, truly: 'Tis hard to tell whether the Lady or Mr. Tattle be the more obliged to you. For you found her Vertue, upon the Backwardness of the Men; and his Secresie, upon the mistrust of the Women. </p>

                     <speaker>Tatt. </speaker>
                     <p>Gad, it's very true, Madam, I think we are oblig'd to acquit our selves— And for my part— But your Ladyship is to speak first— </p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>No? I can shew Letters, Locketts, Pictures, and Rings; and if there be occasion for Witnesses, I can summon the Maids at the Chocolate-Houses, all the Porters of Pall-Mall and Covent-Garden, the Door-keepers at the Play-House, the Drawers at <hi>Locket's, Pontack's</hi>, the <hi>Rummer, Spring-Garden</hi>; my own Landlady and <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi>; all who shall make Oath, that I receive more Letters than the Secretary's Office; and that I have more Vizor-Masks to enquire for me, than ever went to see the Hermaphrodite, or the Naked Prince. And it is notorious, that in a Country Church, once, an Enquiry being made, who I was, it was answer'd, I was the famous Tattle, who had ruin'd so many Women. </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tatt. </speaker>
                     <p>True; I was call'd Turk-Tattle all over the Parish— The next Sunday all the Old Women kept their Daughters at home, and the Parson had not half his Congregation. He wou'd have brought me into the Spiritual Court, but I was reveng'd upon him, for he had a handsom Daughter whom I initiated into the Science. But I repented it afterwards, for it was talk'd of in Town— And a Lady of Quality that shall be nameless, in a raging Fit of Jealousie, came down in her Coach and Six Horses, and expos'd her self upon my Account; Gad, I was sorry for it with all my Heart— You know whom I mean— You know where we raffl'd— </p>

                     <p>Gad so, the Heat of my Story carry'd me beyond my Discretion, as the Heat of the Lady's Passion hurry'd her beyond her Reputation— But I hope you don't know whom I mean; for there were a great many Ladies raffled— Pox on't, now could I bite off my Tongue. </p>

                     <p>What, is my Son Valentine gone? What, is he sneak'd off, and would not see his Brother? There's an Unnatural Whelp! There's an ill natur'd Dog! What, were you here too, Madam, and could not keep him! Cou'd neither Love, nor Duty, nor Natural Affection oblige him. Odsbud, Madam, have no more to say to him; he is not worth your Consideration. The Rogue has not a Drachm of Generous Love about him: All Interest, all Interest; he's an undone Scoundrel, and courts your Estate: Body o' me, he does not care a Doit for your Person. </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ang. </speaker>
                     <p>I'm pretty even with him, Sir Sampson; for if ever I cou'd have lik'd any thing in him, it shou'd have been his Estate too: But since that's gone, the Bait's off, and the naked Hook appears. </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Samp. </speaker>
                     <p>Odsbud, well spoken; and you are a Wiser Woman than I thought you were: For most young Women now-a-days are to be tempted with a naked Hook. </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ang. </speaker>
                     <p>If I marry, Sir Sampson, I'm for a good Estate with any Man, and for any Man with a good Estate: Therefore if I were obliged to make a Choice, I declare I'd rather have you than your Son. </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Samp. </speaker>
                     <p>Faith and Troth you're a wise Woman, and I'm glad to hear you say so; I was afraid you were in Love with the Reprobate; Odd, I was sorry for you with all my Heart: Hang him, Mungrel; cast him off; you shall see the Rogue shew himself, and make Love to some desponding Cadua of Fourscore for Sustenance. Odd, I love to see a young Spend thrist forc'd to cling to an Old Woman for Support, like Ivy round a dead Oak: Faith I do; I love to see 'em hug and cotten together, like Down upon a Thistle. </p>

But I'll tell you why I don't much stand towards Matrimonie. I love to roam about from Port to Port, and from Land to Land: I could never abide to be Port-bound as we call it: Now a man that is marry'd, has as it were, d'ee see, his seet in the Bilboes, and may hap may'nt get 'em out again when he wou'd. </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ben. </speaker>
                     <p>Say'n you so forsooth? Marry and I shou'd like such a handsome Gentlewoman for a Bed-fellow hugely, how say you Mistress, wou'd you like going to Sea? Mess you're a tight Vessel, and well rigg'd, an you were but as well Mann'd. </p>

                     <speaker>Ben. </speaker>
                     <p>But I'll tell you one thing, an you come to Sea in a high Wind, or that Lady. — You mayn't carry so much Sail o'your Head— Top and Top-gallant by the Mess. </p>

                     <p>An we were a League asunder, I'de undertake to hold Discourse with you, an 'twere not a main high Wind indeed, and full in my Teeth. Look you forsooth, I am as it were, bound for the Land of Matrimony; 'tis a Voyage d'ee see that was none of my seeking, I was commanded by Father, and if you like of it, may-hap I may steer into your Harbour. How say you Mistress? the short of the thing is this, that if you like me, and I like you, we may chance to swing in a Hammock together. </p>

                     <p>I don't know what to say to you, nor I don't care to speak with you at all. </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ben. </speaker>
                     <p>No, I'm sorry for that. — But pray why are you so scornful? </p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Miss. </speaker>
                     <p>As long as one must not speak one's mind, one had better not speak at all, I think, and truly I won't tell a lie for the matter. </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ben. </speaker>
                     <p>Nay, You say true in that, it's but a folly to lie: For to speak one thing, and to think just the contrary way; is as it were, <pb n="31a" xml:id="A34302-031-a"/>to look one way, and to row another. Now, for my part d'ee see, I'm for carrying things above Board, I'm not for keeping any thing under Hatches, — so that if you ben't as willing as I, say so a God's name, there's no harm done; may-hap you may be shame-fac'd, some Maidens thof ' they love a man well enough, yet they don't care to tell'n so to's face: If that's the Case, why silence gives consent. </p>

                     <speaker>Miss. </speaker>
                     <p>But I'm sure it is not so, for I'll speak sooner than you should believe that; and I'll speak truth, tho' one should always tell a lie to a man; and I don't care, let my Father do what he will; I'm too big to be whipt, so I'll tell you plainly, I don't like you, nor love you at all, nor never will, that's more: So, there's your answer for you; and don't trouble me no more, you ugly thing. </p>

                     <p>Look you Young Woman, You may learn to give good words however. I spoke you fair d'ee see, and civil. — As for your Love or your liking, I don't value it of a Rope's end; — And may-hap I like you as little as you do me: — What I said was in Obedience to Father; Gad I fear a Whipping no more than you do. But I tell you one thing, if you shou'd give such Language at Sea, you'd have a Cat o' Nine-tails laid cross your Shoulders. Flesh who are you? You heard t'other handsome Young Woman speak civilly to me, of her own accord: Whatever you think of your self, Gad I don't think you are any more to compare to her, than a Cann of Small-beer to a Bowl of Punch. </p>

What do's Father mean to leave me alone as soon as I come home, with such a dirty dowdy. — Sea-calf? I an't Calf enough to lick your Chalk'd face, You Cheese-curd you, — Marry thee!

                     <p>Body o'me, I don't know any universal Grievance, but a new Tax, and the loss of the Canary Fleet. Without Popery shou'd be landed in the West, or the French Fleet were at Anchor at Blackwall. </p>

                     <p>Something has appear'd to your Son Valentine— He's gone to Bed upon't, and very ill— He speaks little, yet says he has a World to say. Asks for his Father and the Wise Foresight; talks of <hi>Raymond Lully</hi>, and the Ghost of Lilly. He has Secrets to impart I suppose to you two. I can get nothing out of him but Sighs. He desires he may see you in the Morning, but would not be disturb'd to Night, because he has some Business to do in a Dream. </p>

                     <p>Hoity toity, What have I to do with his Dreams or his Divination— Body o' me, this is a Trick to defer Signing the Conveyance. I warrant the Devil will tell him in a Dream, that he must not part with his Estate: But I'll bring him a Parson to tell him, that the Devil's a Liar— Or if that won't do, I'll <pb n="32b" xml:id="A34302-032-b"/>bring a Lawyer that shall out-lie the Devil. And so I'll try whether my Black-Guard or his shall get the better of the Day. </p>

                     <p>Alas, Mr. Foresight, I'm afraid all is not right— You are a Wise Man, and a Conscientious Man; a Searcher into Obscurity and Futurity; and if you commit an Error, it is with a great deal of Consideration, and Discretion, and Caution— </p>

You are wise, and shou'd not be over-reach'd, methinks you shou'd not— </p>

                     <p>A Trifler— but a Lover of Art— And the Wise Men of the East ow'd their Instruction to a Star, which is rightly observ'd by Gregory the Great in favour of Astrology!

                     <p>I thank my Stars that have inclin'd me— But I fear this Marriage and making over this Estate, this transferring of a rightful Inheritance, will bring Judgments upon us. I prophesie it, and I wou'd not have the Fate of Cassandra, not to be believ'd. Valentine is disturb'd, what can be the Cause of that? And Sir Sampson is hurry'd on by an unusual Violence— I fear he does not act wholly from himself; methinks he does not look as he used to do. </p>

                     <p>Yes, Sir; you need make no great doubt of that; he that was so near turning Poet yesterday morning, can't be much to seek in playing the Madman to day. </p>

                     <p>No, Sir, not yet; — He has a mind to try, whether his playing the Madman, won't make her play the Fool, and fall in Love with him; or at least own that she has lov'd him all this while, and conceal'd it. </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Scan. </speaker>
                     <p>Not upon a kind occasion, Madam. But when a Lady comes Tyrannically to insult a ruin'd Lover, and make manifest the cruel Triumphs of her Beauty; the barbarity of it, something surprizes me. </p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Iere. </speaker>
                     <p>No strange matter, Madam; my Master's mad, that's all: I suppose your Ladyship has thought him so a great while. </p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>Why faith, Madam, he's mad for want of his Wits, just as he was for want of Money; his Head is e'en as light as his Pockets; and any body that has a mind to a bad Bargain, can't do better than to beg him for his Estate. </p>

                     <p>Mr. Scandal, you can't think me guilty of so much Inhumanity, as not to be concern'd for a Man I must own my self oblig'd to— pray tell me truth. </p>

                     <p>Faith, Madam, I wish telling a Lie would mend the matter. But this is no new effect of an unsuccessful Passion. </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ang. </speaker>
                     <p>Ha! I saw him wink and smile— I fancy 'tis a trick— I'll try— I would disguise to all the World a Failing, which I must own to you— I fear my Happiness depends upon the recovery of Valentine. Therefore I conjure you, as you are his Friend, and as you have Compassion upon one fearful of Affliction, to tell me what I am to hope for— I cannot speak— But you may tell me, tell me, for you know what I wou'd ask? </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Scan. </speaker>
                     <p>So, this is pretty plain— Be not too much concern'd, Madam; I hope his Condition is not desperate: An Acknowledgment of Love from you, perhaps, may work a Cure; as the fear of your Aversion occasion'd his Distemper. </p>

                     <p>Say you so; nay, then I'm convinc'd: And if I don't play Trick for Trick, may I never taste the Pleasure of Revenge— Acknowledgment of Love! I find you have mistaken my Compassion, and think me guilty of a Weakness I am a Stranger to. But I have too much Sincerity to deceive you, and too much Charity to suffer him to be deluded with vain Hopes. Good Nature and Humanity oblige me to be concern'd for him; but to Love is neither in my Power nor Inclination; <pb n="37b" xml:id="A34302-037-b"/>and if he can't be cur'd without I suck the Poyson from his Wounds, I'm afraid he won't recover his Senses till I lose mine. </p>

                     <p>Most Tyrannically, — for you see he has got the start of me; and I the poor forsaken Maid am left complaining on the Shore. But I'll tell you a hint that he has given me; Sir Sampson is enrag'd, and talks desperately of committing Matrimony himself. — If he has a mind to throw himself away, he can't do it more effectually than upon me, if we could bring it about. </p>

                     <p>Valentine raves upon Angelica, and took me for her, and Ieremy says will take any body for her that he imposes on him. — Now I have promis'd him Mountains; if in one of his mad fits he will bring you to him in her stead, and get you married together, and put to Bed together; and after Consummation, Girl, there's no revoking. And if he should recover his Senses, he'll be glad at least to make you a good Settlement. — Here they come, stand aside a little, and tell me how you like the design. </p>

Wives and Husbands will drive distinct Trades, and Care and Pleasure separately Occupy the Family. Coffee-Houses will be full of Smoak and Stratagem. And the cropt Prentice, that sweeps his Master's Shop in the morning, may ten to one, dirty his Sheets before Night.

                     <p>Partly I think— for he does not know his Mind Two Hours— I'm sure I left him just now, in a Humour to be mad: And I think I have not found him very quiet at this present. Who's there? </p>

                     <p>Wou'd any thing, but a Madman complain of Uncertainty? Uncertainty and Expectation are the Joys of Life. Security is an insipid thing, and the overtaking and possessing of a Wish, discovers the Folly of the Chase. Never let us know one another better; for the Pleasure of a Masquerade is done, when we come to shew Faces; But I'll tell you two things before I leave you; I am not the Fool you take me for; and you are Mad and don't know it. </p>

                     <p>they say so of a Witches Pray'r, and Dreams and Dutch Almanacks are to be understood by contraries. But there's Regularity and Method in that; she is a Medal without a Reverse or Inscription; for Indifference has both sides alike. Yet while she does not seem to hate me, I will pursue her, and know her if it be possible, in spight of the Opinion of my Satirical Friend, Scandal, who says, <q>
                           <l>That Women are like Tricks by slight of Hand, </l>
                           <l>Which, to admire, we should not understand. </l>

                     <p>I have not been honour'd with the Commands of a fair Lady, a great while— Odd, Madam, you have reviv'd me— Not since I was Five and Thirty. </p>

                     <speaker>Ang. </speaker>
                     <p>Why you have no great reason to complain, Sir Sampson, that is not long ago. </p>

                     <speaker>Sir Samp. </speaker>
                     <p>Zooks, but it is, Madam, a very great while; to a Man that admires a fine Woman, as much as I do. </p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Ang. </speaker>
                     <p>You're an absolute Courtier, Sir Sampson. </p>

                     <speaker>Sir Samp. </speaker>
                     <p>Not at all, Madam: Odsbud you wrong me; I am not so old neither, to be a bare Courtier, only a Man of Words. Odd, I have warm Blood about me yet, I can serve a Lady any way— Come, come, let me tell you, you Women think a Man old too soon, faith and troth you do— Come, don't despise Fifty; odd Fifty, in a hale Constitution, is no such contemptible Age. </p>

                     <speaker>Ang. </speaker>
                     <p>Fifty a contemptible Age! Not at all, a very fashionable Age I think— I assure you I know very considerable <pb n="47b" xml:id="A34302-047-b"/>Beaus, that set a good Face upon Fifty, Fifty! I have seen Fifty in a side Box by Candle-light, out-blossom Five and Twenty. </p>

                     <p>O Pox, outsides, outsides; a pize take 'em, meer outsides. Hang your side-Box Beaus; no, I'm none of those, none of your forc'd Trees, that pretend to Blossom in the Fall; and Bud when they should bring forth Fruit. I am of a long liv'd Race, and inherit Vigour, none of my Family married till Fifty; yet they begot Sons and Daughters till Fourscore. I am of your Patriarchs, I, a Branch of one of your Antideluvian Families, Fellows, that the Flood could not wash away. Well, Madam, what are your Commands? Has any young Rogue affronted you, and shall I cut his Throat? or— </p>

                     <p>No, Sir▪ Sampson, I have no Quarrel upon my Hands— I have more Occasion for your Conduct than your Courage at this time. To tell you the Truth, I'm weary of living single, and want a Husband. </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Samp. </speaker>
                     <p>Odsbud, and 'tis pity you should— Odd, wou'd she wou'd like me, then I shou'd hamper my young Rogues: Odd, wou'd she wou'd; faith and troth she's devilish Handsom. </p>
                     <stage>Aside. </stage>
                     <p>Madam, you deserve a good Husband, and 'twere pity you shou'd be thrown away upon any of these young idle Rogues about the Town. Odd, there's ne're a young Fellow worth hanging— that is a very young Fellow— Pize on 'em, they never think beforehand of any thing; — And if they commit Matrimony, 'tis as they commit Murder; out of a Frolick: And are ready to hang themselves, or to be hang'd by the Law, the next Morning. — Odso, have a care, Madam. </p>

                     <speaker>Ang. </speaker>
                     <p>Therefore I ask your Advice, Sir Sampson: I have Fortune enough to make any Man easie that I can like; If there were such a thing as a young agreeable Man, with a reasonable Stock of good Nature and Sense— For I would neither have an absolute Wit, nor a Fool. </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Samp. </speaker>
                     <p>Odd, you are hard to please, Madam; to find a young Fellow that is neither a Wit in his own Eye, nor a Fool in the Eye of the World, is a very hard Task. But, faith and troth you speak very discreetly; For I hate both a Wit and a Fool. </p>

                     <speaker>Angl. </speaker>
                     <p>She that marries a Fool, Sir Sampson, commits the Reputation of her Honesty or Understanding to the Censure of the <pb n="48a" xml:id="A34302-048-a"/>World: And she that marries a very Witty Man, submits both to the Severity and insolent Conduct of her Husband. I should like a Man of Wit for a Lover, because I would have such an one in my Power; but I would no more be his Wife, than his Enemy. For his Malice is not a more terrible Consequence of his Aversion, than his Jealousie is of his Love. </p>

                     <p>None of old <hi>Foresight's Sybills </hi>ever utter'd such a Truth. Odsbud, you have wone my Heart: I hate a Wit; I had a Son that was spoil'd among 'em; a good hopeful Lad, till he learn'd to be a Wit— And might have risen in the State— But, a pox on't, his Wit run him out of his Money, and now his Poverty has run him out of his Wits. </p>

                     <p>Sir Sampson, as your Friend, I must tell you, you are very much abus'd in that Matter; He's no more Mad than you are. </p>

                     <p>— Ah, Madam, all my Affairs are scarce worthy to be laid at your Feet; And I wish, Madam, they stood in a better Posture, that I might make a more becoming Offer to a Lady of your incomparable Beauty and Merit. — If I had Peru in one Hand, and Mexico in t'other, and the Eastern Empire under my Feet; it would make me only a more glorious Victim to be offer'd at the Shrine of your Beauty. </p>

I ask'd your Advice for a Husband, and you are giving me your Consent— I was indeed thinking to propose something like it in a Jest, to satisfie you about Valentine: For if a Match were seemingly carried on, between you and me, it would oblige him to throw off his Disguise of Madness, in Apprehension of losing me: For you know he has long pretended a Passion for me. </p>

                     <speaker>Sir Samp. </speaker>
                     <p>Gadzooks, a most ingenuous Contrivance— If we were to go throw with it. But why must the Match only be seemingly carried on? — Odd, let it be a real Contract. </p>

                     <speaker>Ang. </speaker>
                     <p>O fie, Sir Sampson, what would the World say? </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Samp. </speaker>
                     <p>Say, they would say, you were a wise Woman, and I a happy Man. Odd, Madam, I'll love you as long as I live; and leave you a good Jointure when I die. </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ang. </speaker>
                     <p>Aye; But that is not in your Power, Sir Sampson; for when Valentine confesses himself in his Senses; he must make over his Inheritance to his younger Brother. </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Samp. </speaker>
                     <p>Odd, you're cunning, a wary Baggage! Faith and Troth I like you the better— But, I warrant you, I have a Proviso in the Obligation in favour of my self— Body o'me, I have a Trick to turn the Settlement upon the Issue Male of our Two Bodies begotten. Odsbud, let us find Children, and I'll find an Estate. </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Samp. </speaker>
                     <p>O Rogue! But I'll trust you. And will you consent? Is it a Match then? </p>

                     <p>With all my Heart; — Come in with me, and I'll lend you the Bond, — You shall consult your Lawyer, and I'll consult a Parson; Odzooks I'm a Young Man: Odzooks I'm a young Man, and I'll make it appear— Odd, you're devilish Handsom; Faith and Troth, you're very Handsom, and I'm very Young, and very Lusty— Odsbud, Hussy, you know how to chuse, and so do I; — Odd, I think we are very well met; — Give me your Hand, Odd let me kiss it; 'tis as warm and as soft— as what? — Odd, as t'other Hand— give me t'other Hand, and I'll mumble 'em, and kiss 'em till they melt in my Mouth. </p>

                     <p>Hold, Sir Sampson— You're profuse of your Vigour before your time: You'll spend your Estate before you come to it. </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Samp. </speaker>
                     <p>No, no, only give you a Rent-roll of my Possessions— Ah! Baggage— I warrant you; for little Sampson: <pb n="49a" xml:id="A34302-049-a"/>Odd, Sampson's a very good Name for an able Fellow: Your Sampsons were strong Dogs from the Beginning. </p>

                     <p>Have a care, and don't over-act your Part— If you remember, the strongest Sampson of your Name, pull'd an old House over his Head at last. </p>

                     <p>Aye, Sir, she's just going to the Place of appointment. Ah Sir, if you are not very faithful and close in this Business, you'll certainly be the Death of a Person that has a most extraordinary Passion for your Honour's Service. </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>Even my unworthy self, Sir— Sir, I have had an Appetite to be fed with your Commands a great while; — And now, Sir, my former Master, having much troubled the Fountain of his Understanding; it is a very plausible Occasion for me to quench my Thirst at the Spring of your Bounty— I thought I could not recommend my self better to you, Sir, than by the delivery of a great Beauty and Fortune into your Arms, whom I have heard you Sigh for. </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>I'll make thy Fortune; say no more— Thou art a pretty Fellow, and canst carry a Message to a Lady, in a pretty soft kind of Phrase, and with a good perswading Accent. </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tatt. </speaker>
                     <p>Ay; 'tis well enough for a Servant to be bred at an University: But the Education is a little too pedantick for a Gentleman. I hope you are secret in your Nature, private, close, ha? </p>

                     <p>O Sir, for that Sir, 'tis my chief Talent; I'm as secret as the Head of Nilus. </p>

                     <p>A cunning AEgyptian, Sir, that with <pb n="49b" xml:id="A34302-049-b"/>his Arms would over-run the Country, yet no body could ever find out his Head-Quarters. </p>

                     <p>Aye, Sir, hooded like a Hawk, to seize at first sight upon the Quarry. It is the Whim of my Master's Madness to be so dress'd; and she is so in Love with him, she'll comply with any thing to please him. Poor Lady, I'm sure she'll have reason to pray for me, when she finds what a happy Exchange she has made, between a Madman and so Accomplish'd a Gentleman. </p>

                     <p>Ay faith, so she will, Ieremy: You're a good Friend to her, poor Creature— I swear I do it hardly so much in consideration of my self, as Compassion to her. </p>

                     <p>Ay, but your Father will tell you that Dreams come by Contraries, Child— O fie; what, we must not love one another now— Pshaw, that would be a foolish thing indeed— — Fie, fie, you're a Woman now, and must think of a new Man every Morning, and forget him every Night— — No, no, to marry, is to be a Child again, and play with the same Rattle always: O fie, marrying is a paw thing. </p>

I have no more love for your Daughter, than I have likeness of you; and I have a Secret in my Heart, which you wou'd be glad to know, and shan't know; and yet you shall know it too, and be sorry for't afterwards. I'd have you to know, Sir, that I am as knowing as the Stars, and as secret as the Night. — And I'm going to be Married just now, yet did not know of it half an Hour ago; and the Lady stays for me, and does not know of it yet— There's a Mystery for you, — I know you love to untie Difficulties— Or if you can't solve this; stay here a Quarter of an Hour, and I'll come and explain it to you. </p>

Oh! methinks I'm sick when I think of a Man▪ ; and if I can't have one, I wou'd go to sleep all my Life: For when I'm awake, it makes me wish and long, and I don't know for what— And I'd rather be always a sleeping, than sick with thinking. </p>

Look you, Friend, if I may advise you, when she's going, for that you must expect, I have Experience of her, when she's going, let her go. For no Matrimony is tough enough to hold her, and if she can't drag her Anchor along with her, she'll break her Cable, I can tell you that. Who's here? the Madman? </p>

I always lov'd your Son, and hated your unforgiving Nature. I was resolv'd to try him to the utmost; I have try'd you too, and know you both. You have not more Faults than he has Virtues; and 'tis hardly more Pleasure to me, that I can make him and my self happy, than that I can punish you. </p>

                     <p>Sir, I ask you Ten Thousand Pardons, 'twas an errant mistake— You see, Sir, my Master was never mad, nor any thing like it— Then how could it be otherwise? </p>

                     <p>Tattle, I thank you, you would have interposed between me and Heav'n; but Providence laid Purgatory in your way— You have but Justice. </p>

                     <p>I have done dissembling now, Valentine; and if that Coldness which I have always worn before you, should turn to an extream Fondness, you must not suspect it. </p>

                     <speaker>Val. </speaker>
                     <p>I'll prevent that suspicion— For I intend to doat on at that immoderate rate, that your Fondness shall never distinguish it self enough, to be taken notice of. If ever you seem to love too much, it must be only when I can't love enough. </p>

                     <p>Well, Madam, You have done Exemplary Justice, in punishing an inhumane Father, and rewarding a Faithful Lover: But there is a Third good Work, which I, in particular, must thank you for; I was an Infidel to your Sex; and you have converted me— For now I am convinc'd that all Women are not like Fortune, blind in bestowing Favours, either on those who do not merit, or who do not want 'em. </p>

                     <p>'Tis an unreasonable Accusation, that you lay upon our Sex: You tax us with Injustice, only to cover your own want of Merit. You would all have the Reward of Love; but few have the Constancy to stay till it becomes your due. Men are <pb n="55a" xml:id="A34302-055-a"/>generally. Hypocrites and Infidels, they pretend to Worship, but have neither Zeal nor Faith: How few, like Valentine, would persevere even unto Martyrdom, and sacrifice their Interest to their Constancy! In admiring me, you misplace the Novelty. <q>
