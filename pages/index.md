## **Overview**
<hr/>
William Congreve's dramatic works indubitably occupy an integral position in the world of Restoration theatre. The theatrical approach in his comedy of manners, in which he employs elements from the works of playwrights such as Jonson and Moli√®re, creates an intriguing opportunity for data visualisation. As data visualisation techniques enable the presentation of large sets of data in an accessible manner, using these methods on Congreve's works can open up opportunities for communication, pedagogy, and research related to the dramatist. The aim of this project is to explore and demonstrate some of the ways through which the Congrivian oeuvre can be visualised as a whole through the use of statistical data and graphs. This project only features Congreve's comedies as *The Mourning Bride* (1697), his only tragedy, deserves seperate attention due to the generic differences.
